# capstoneWinter2022 WALLE in the Garage
This is python code to run a BMP280 temperature and pressure sensor along with a 
HCSR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor and LED at the same time.  
This script uses inspirations from a BME280 sensor found on:
https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2016/07/using-bme280-i2c-temperature-pressure-sensor-in-python/
The blog where we learned to put python scrupts together is found here:

## What is this script supposed to do?
Run the scripts for HCSR04 and BMP280 sensor at the same time
and have their data values written to the Firbase Database in different time intervals

## Purpose of this Project 
Our Winter 2022 capstone project is a garage monitoring system that allows the
user to monitor the temperature of the garage along with useing the ditance sensor
to help the user park their car in the garage
