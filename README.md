# capstoneWinter2022 WALLE in the Garage
This is python code to hook up a BME280 temp and pressure sensor along with a 
HCSR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
This script uses inspirations from a BME280 sensor found on:
https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2016/07/using-bme280-i2c-temperature-pressure-sensor-in-python/
The blog where we learned to put python scrupts together is found here:

## What is this script supposed to do?
Run the scripts for HCSR04 and BME280 sensor at the same time
and have their data values written to the Firbase DataBase at the same time

## Purpose of this Project 
Our Winter 2022 capstone project is a garage monitoring system that allows the
user to monitor the temperature of the garage along with useing the ditance sensor
to help the user park their car in the garage
